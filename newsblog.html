							<h2>Spongebob squarepants</h2>
							<p>
								SpongeBob SquarePants, the show's namesake character and main character. The yellow rectangular sponge has a body structure similar to that of a cleaning sponge. Wearing brown shorts, a white shirt and a red tie. I wear a chef's hat when I work. Although I eat normally, I can still survive by filtering seawater. Physical weakness, every morning will lift the dumbbell and the so-called dumbbell is actually a fluffy toy; But it seems to get better as the plot goes on.

							<h2>Patrick Star</h2>
							<p>
								Patrick Star, he is SpongeBob's best friend, is a pink starfish. His IQ is so low that his mind is only connected to his body by a plug. Broad and strong, strong. He screwed up everything, but he sailed exceptionally well, and lived under a large round rock. Preference to sleep. Interest is watching TV, like no signal picture. Very silly.

							<h2>Squidward Tentacles</h2>
							<p>
								Squiddy Brother, he is an octopus with a big nose. His neighbors are SpongeBob and Patrick, but he hates them and gives him a lot of trouble every time. He is quite narcissistic and thinks he has artistic talent. They live in a house that looks like an Easter Island. Worked as a counter clerk at the Kb Krab, but didn't like his job. He played the clarinet (awful) and painted himself in various styles, occasionally expressing his appreciation for SpongeBob SquarePants.

							<h2>Eugene H. Krabs</h2>
							<p>
								Eugene H. Krabs is a miser. When he sees money, he always looks at it like life. He often risks his life for just one dollar. In order to earn more money, he often reads newspapers, counts money, takes money bath and so on in the office during business hours. He likes watching satirical dramas. He lives in a world of his own, and he is the bitter enemy of the boss.

							<h2>Plankton</h2>
							<p>
								Boss Pie is a plankton and the only villain in Spongebob SquarePants. He is extremely small and has only one eye. His wife is a computer named Karen. In order to make his own restaurant business prosper, he has been stealing the ancestral secret recipe of "Delicious Crab Burger" from the famous Crab Burger King, but he has never succeeded. His greatest hope is to rule the whole world (the ambition is also very big).

							<h2>Sandy Cheeks</h2>
							<p>
								Sandy, a land squirrel from Texas, befriends SpongeBob SpongeBob, an inventor and karate master who appears every time wearing a spacesuit and helmet. The interior of the undersea treehouse is the same as on land, where people usually live under a large round reinforced glass shield

							<h2>Mrs. Puff</h2>
							<p>
								She is a Mola, the coach of SpongeBob's driving training class. Because SpongeBob's driving skills are very poor, he is neurotic. When you are overactive or overactive, your whole body will swell. She was once in love with the crab boss, but when she dated with the crab boss, she would spend a lot of money, which made the crab boss puzzled and finally died of nothing.
